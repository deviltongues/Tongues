0) The Tongues team must use PyCharm going forward.  Download and install it if 
   you don’t already have it.
1) Open PyCharm and clone the new repo from: https://github.com/deviltongues/Tongues.git
2) Add a new interpreter to your project (.venv directory, virtual 
   environment)
3) Install the deviltongues package and all its dependencies with `pip install 
-e .` to create an editable local install of your project
